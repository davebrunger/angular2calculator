# Angular 2 Calculator

This repository demos a simple calculator and is based on the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).
The code that implements the calculator is similar to the code in my [React based calculator](https://github.com/davebrunger/ReactCalculator).
I started out by forking the [Angular Quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) repository and did the developement in Visual Studio Code.
